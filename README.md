Mostly Harmless Server

======================

By Ender

======================

This is a Pokemon Online server script. For more information, see:

http://pokemon-online.eu/

This server script was made and is currently being managed by [HH]Ender on the Mostly Harmless server, but use of this project is fine for others who wish to use it. Though the bulk of the activity takes place on the server, Mostly Harmless has a forum here:

To use this script, run $git clone in your server's directory.
